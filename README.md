# StockBot1.0

This is a discord bot that prints the current price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in response to the messages "$eth" and "$btc" respectively.
To use it, you'll have to install the necessary python modules: discord, requests and beautifulsoup4.
After that, sign into the discord developer dashboard and create a new discord application. Name it whatever you want. Create a bot under that application named whatever you want.
Set its permissions to at least allow reading and sending messages. Generate and copy the bot's OAuth token and invite the bot to a server of your choice. Run stockbot.py.
